        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> This is one of my most favorite recipes that my mom used to make. Whenever she put her cast-iron pot onto the stove, I knew that I was in for a delicious meal. Although my family is very Italian, my Nana was sorely lacking in the recipes department, so I can't attribute it's greatness to my deep Italian background. But the interplay of the savory flavors of the sausage and pepperoni and the dedacent mozzarella cheese will have you dying for more.</p> 
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1 tablespoon olive oil

            </li>
            <li>
                1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
            </li>
            <li>
                8 ounces rotini pasta
            </li>
            <li>
                Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
            </li>
            <li>
                2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
            </li>
        </ul>      
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to broil.
                </li>
                <li>
                Heat olive oil in a large oven-proof skillet over medium high heat. Add Italian sausage and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the sausage as it cooks; drain excess fat. Stir in 1/4 cup pepperoni until heated through, about 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li>
                Stir in tomato sauce, oregano, basil garlic powder, pasta and 1 1/2 cups water; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat and simmer until pasta is cooked through, about 12-14 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                Remove from heat; top with mozzarella and remaining 1/4 cup pepperoni. Place into oven and cook until melted and golden brown, about 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.
