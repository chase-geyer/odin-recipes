            <li>
                2 tablespoons white sugar
            </li>
            <li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour soy sauce, water, vinegar, and sesame oil into a large, non-metallic bowl. Whisk in onion, garlic, brown sugar, white sugar, and pepper, whisking until sugars dissolve. Submerge ribs in the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate 7 to 12 hours; the longer, the better.

            <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove ribs from marinade and shake off excess; discard marinade.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook on the preheated grill until the meat is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
